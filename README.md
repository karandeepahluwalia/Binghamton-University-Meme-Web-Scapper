# Binghamton-University-Meme-Web-Scapper

Currently is set up so that using a Flask backend we can attach any photo onto the Web API on the root page and it will run the Facial recognition to delete which politcal candidates are identified in the photo. Plan to update by create a web scapper
to automatically collect photos on Twitter, Reddit etc and feed into the Python backend so that User Interface is not needed.

Attach and submit photo on root page and view the results in the page "/result"
